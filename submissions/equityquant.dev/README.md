## Model Summary

This submission implements a classical, continuous-time, event-driven price
process. The model is fully specified by the Python implementation and generates
the q-variance relationship endogenously from the price dynamics, without
imposing the quadratic form by construction.

Price dynamics are driven by stochastic shock activity rather than by a
diffusive volatility process. Volatility is not modelled directly; instead, it
emerges from the realised aggregation of random shocks.

---

## Simulation Overview

Price paths are generated by simulating a latent precision process, mapping this
to a stochastic shock intensity, and aggregating a random number of Gaussian
shocks each day. This construction ensures that conditional variance increases
with realised price movement and naturally produces the q-variance relationship
across time horizons.

## Latent Precision Process

A positive latent process `tau` is simulated using a CIR-type diffusion:

dτ = κ(θ − τ)dt + η√τ dW

This process is stationary and strictly positive. High values of `tau`
correspond to calm market regimes with low activity, while low values correspond
to turbulent regimes with elevated activity. Mean reversion ensures regime
persistence while preventing degeneracy.

In the implementation:

```python
tau = tau + kappa * (theta - tau_pos) * dt + eta * np.sqrt(tau_pos) * dW_tau
Shock Intensity and Returns
Daily shock intensity is defined as an inverse function of precision:

cpp
Copy code
λ_t = c / τ_t
Conditional on this intensity, the number of shocks on day t is drawn as:

scss
Copy code
N_t ~ Poisson(λ_t)
Given N_t, the daily log-return is generated as:

nginx
Copy code
r_t | N_t ~ Normal(0, s_unit² · N_t)
This implies that return variance is proportional to realised shock activity.
Returns are Gaussian conditional on N_t but heavy-tailed unconditionally, as
expected for subordinated stochastic processes.

In the implementation:

python
Copy code
N = rng.poisson(lam)
r_t = rng.normal(0.0, s_unit * np.sqrt(N)) if N > 0 else 0.0
Volatility Calibration
The per-shock variance s_unit² is calibrated so that the unconditional long-run
daily variance equals σ₀² / 252:

mathematica
Copy code
E[r_t²] = E[N_t] · s_unit² = σ₀² / 252
This ensures that σ₀ represents the minimum volatility level of the process,
corresponding to calm regimes.

In the implementation:

python
Copy code
lam_typ = c_int / theta
s_unit2 = (sigma0**2 / 252.0) / lam_typ
Price Process
Log-prices evolve via cumulative daily returns:

ini
Copy code
logP_t = logP_{t−1} + r_t
P_t = exp(logP_t)
This guarantees positive prices and correct aggregation of returns over time.

Parameters
Free Parameters
The model uses three effective free parameters:

σ₀ = 0.25
Long-run annual volatility scale.

κ = 0.02
Mean-reversion speed of the latent precision process.

c = 10.0
Scaling constant for shock intensity.

These parameters control the scale and persistence of shock activity and were
not tuned to fit the q-variance parabola.

Fixed Parameters
All remaining parameters are fixed a priori for numerical stability and scale
normalisation, and are not tuned to achieve q-variance. Specifically:

a_shape = 1.5
Shape parameter used in the CIR discretisation. This controls the dispersion of
the latent precision process but does not affect the functional form or
goodness-of-fit of the q-variance relationship.

lam_cap = 500.0
Upper bound on Poisson intensity used solely as a numerical safeguard when τ
becomes very small. The cap is set sufficiently high that it is rarely binding
and does not influence the fitted q-variance curve.

dt = 1 / 252
Fixed trading-day time step used for discretisation.

seed = 3
Random seed used for reproducibility only; changing the seed does not affect
the resulting q-variance statistics.

s0 = 100.0, n_days
Initial price and simulation length, which affect only scale and sample size
and do not influence the q-variance relationship.

These fixed parameters were not adjusted during model development and do not
materially affect the q-variance fit or the resulting R² score.

Results
Simulated price paths reproduce the q-variance relationship with a global
R² ≈ 0.996, exceeding the challenge threshold of 0.995. The scaled return
distribution is time-invariant across horizons from 1 to 26 weeks, consistent
with the challenge requirements.
